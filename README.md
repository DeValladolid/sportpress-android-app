For now we have only managed to make a base, which shows a list of events, that if the pulses enters a blank screen.
The idea is that on an initial screen are the news of the blog, in another results ... so with all modules of SportPress.


----------
The "grace" of the app is that it is the perfect substitute for the website, that is, make a design more intuitive for the user.
In the official app is not going to put publicity, but if the developer wants can put it without problem.
